![Founders - Alvin & Eugene](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8526fb2ccd5ef60b73e5c80d3a43285e81d64f28.jpg)

We are established in Malaysia since 2010, professionally providing carton box supply and services to various industries in the country.

We constantly have reject (but new!) boxes due to printing or sizing errors. These reject boxes are brand new and durable in quality.

Our location is in Klang, Selangor. Address as below:

Boxman Enterprise

92, Jalan Zapin 3a, Bandar Bukit Raja 41050 Klang.
