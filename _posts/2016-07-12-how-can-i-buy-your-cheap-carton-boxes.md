# How can I buy your Cheap Carton Boxes?

You can call us at 03-3362 5205 or send us an email on your order. We will check for stock availability and let you know.

You can then come to our warehouse to pick it up. We are strictly cash-and-carry business. We do not have e-commerce services. Deliveries can be arranged at cost (usually RM50-RM80 per trip).

Our address is 92, Jalan Zapin 3a, Bandar Bukit Raja, Klang, Selangor Malaysia. Or you can use Waze and search for Boxman.
